# Installing the Optical Drive, PSU, and Connections

## With the basics covered, letâ€™s move on to the more intricate steps. These are not challenging due to complexity, but because they require accuracy to avoid errors. Pay close attention when connecting fans, headers, power cables, and SATA cables. Be sure to consult your motherboard manual to verify that each wire and cable is connected correctly. For instance, connecting the PSU fan to a chassis fan connector may trigger a BIOS fan error. Personally, I use a magnifying glass with a built-in light for these connections. It helps me read the fine print on the motherboard, allowing me to double-check everything before powering on the computer for the first time.
