## Step 1: Prepare The Motherboard
### Description
With a basic build, it's easier to install the RAM, M.2, CPU, and cooler onto the motherboard while it's outside the case. The lighting is often better, and you can more easily position the components when working outside of the case.


### Instructions
1. **Start with the M.2.** It's the smallest and easiest to install into the PCI slot. Ensure it's screwed down properly.  
2. **Install the RAM stick(s).** The correct configuration is typically printed on the motherboard in small print (A2, B2 first). Installing RAM in the wrong slot may result in no video output when you power on the system.  
3. **Install the CPU.** On the back of the CPU, there's an arrow. Align it with the arrow on the CPU socket before placing it in the socket. This step is crucial, and the marking on the socket should be clear.   
4. **Install the CPU cooler over the CPU.** In this example, we are using a stock cooler. The brand name is imprinted on the face of the cooler, and I usually position it facing upwards. 
5. Check the components for looseness. It's easy to misplace RAM.  
6. Check the back of the board. Can you see the white plastic posts sticking through from the CPU cooler? If you can, this indicates the cooler is properly installed.
