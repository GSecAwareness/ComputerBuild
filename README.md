# How to Build a Computer

## Introduction
Building a computer is a rewarding experience that offers a deeper understanding of how your machine works and allows for complete customization to suit your needs. 
This tutorial is a work in progress, as I'm using it to learn and practice writing in Markdown for my GitHub page. 
While the content may evolve over time, it reflects the knowledge I've gained from building hundreds of computers over the years.

## Step 1: Prepare Your Workspace
### Description
Set up a clean, static-free workspace where you can lay out all your components. Make sure you have all the tools you'll need, such as a screwdriver.



### Instructions
1. Clear a large, flat surface.
2. Ground yourself to prevent static damage (use an anti-static wristband if available).
3. Lay out all your components and tools.
