## Step 1: Prepare Your Workspace
### Description
Set up a clean, static-free workspace where you can lay out all your components. Make sure you have all the tools you'll need, such as a screwdriver.



### Instructions
1. Clear a large, flat surface.
2. Ground yourself to prevent static damage (use an anti-static wristband if available).
3. Lay out all your components and tools.
4. Prepare the case. Unscrew the side panels and take them off.
5. Pull out any case wiring. This will make our lives much easier later!
